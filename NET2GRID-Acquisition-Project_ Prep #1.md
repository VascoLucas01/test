# **Team Agreement**
### **Cooperation Plan**
**- What are the key strengths of each person on the team?

Sérgio: Problem Solving, Critical Thinking, Good Communicator 

Vasco: Research, Persistent, Enthusiast

Diogo:

- How can you best utilize these strengths in the execution of your project?

Sérgio: Help my colleagues with any issues in any of their tasks, analyze my colleagues work with a critical view and communicate my findings efficiently.

Vasco: Always ask if they need help, give suggestions and welcome them too in order to allow a good flow of the project and team work.

Diogo: 

- In which professional competencies do you each want to develop greater strength?

Sérgio: Organization, Self Confidence

Vasco: Self Confidence, keep calm

Diogo:

- Knowing that every person in your team needs to understand all aspects of the project, how do you plan to approach the day-to-day work?

A private channel/group was created in Slack in order to communicate and update every idea or improvements about the project. In fact, the schedules of each one of the elements of the group are quite different, but we already talked and everyday we’re going to give feedback and try to ensure that all the work is done with all the presence of all the elements.

We will make sure that everyone is on board with every step of the project, having either worked on it or at least understood what was done by the other colleague every time there is a github commit or a decision was taken.


### **Conflict Plan**
- What will be your group’s process to resolve conflict, when it arises?

The best way to resolve conflicts is by expressing your opinion. I think that there are a few questions that we should always ask to come to a conclusion. 

- What is your opinion about this?
- What are the reasons you think that it is a good/better idea?
- In the context of the project, do you think it makes sense?

It is important to share ideas and be in the same boat in order to reach a good port.

- What will your team do if one person is taking over the project and not letting the other members contribute?

This was the first topic discussed in the group. The idea not to leave anyone behind.

Knowing that this is a team project, we need to conclude it as a team and not try to highlight ourselves from the colleagues just to prove a point.

- How will you approach each other and the challenges of the project knowing that it is impossible for all members to be at the exact same place in understanding and skill level?

We will make sure to ask questions about our colleagues' work in order to understand what each person is doing at any given time. Apart from that, we need to be patient with each other. It is important that everyone understands the project and the idea behind it at a high level before jumping in to details.

- How will you raise concerns to members who are not adequately contributing?

We know each other and the commitment we all have with this course. This will not be a problem, but if it happens the idea is to talk with that member and understand the reason behind it, maybe there’s a simple solution that we can work on and improve everyone’s work.

- How and when will you escalate the conflict if your resolution attempts are unsuccessful?

The key is to keep ourselves calm and  de-escalate any type of conflicts promtly. During our professional lives we will need to overcome a lot of barriers and difficulties. In fact, this is just the beginning and it is important to start dealing with that in a better way. In the rare case of  a conflict becoming unmanageable the best approach is with a 2 to 1 or 3 to 0 vote to escalate to either a TA or the lecturer.



### **Communication Plan**
- What hours will you be available to communicate?

Sérgio: I will always be available to communicate. Work hours will be from 9AM to 10PM.

Vasco: I will always be available to communicate. Work hours will be from 7/8/9AM to 10PM.

Diogo:

- What platforms will you use to communicate (ie. Slack, phone …)?

Slack, Remo, WhatsApp, SMS

- How often will you take breaks?

Sérgio: Sundays I tend not to spend a lot of time in front of the computer, unless urgent.

Vasco: Thursday and Sunday from 8am - 10am.

Diogo: 

- What is your plan if you start to fall behind?

Sérgio: Ask my colleagues for help, work locally outside work hours if needed.

Vasco: Talk with my colleagues about what am I doing wrong and ask for help.

Diogo:

- How will you communicate after hours and on the weekend?

Sérgio: I will always be available for a quick message and to help a colleague either via Slack, WhatsApp or SMS.

Vasco: I will always be available.

Diogo:

- What is your strategy for ensuring everyone’s voice is heard?

We will make point-of-situation overviews at the end of each working day to always be aware of each other’s progress and any help they might need. This way everyone knows each other's difficulties and successes.


- How will you ensure that you are creating a safe environment where everyone feels comfortable speaking up?

Sérgio: By having an open-door policy to all questions and problems, making sure that there are no silly questions and that all questions are valid as well as actively asking how work is going.

Vasco: I will always ask for their opinion. We are a team, so we need to know everyone’s opinion to the benefit of the project.

Diogo:
### **Work Plan**
**NOTE**: While researching and experimentation is always encouraged, writing and/or committing code to the project on your own during non-working hours or over the weekend is never acceptable. This puts the entire project at risk. Be explicit in calling out your work hours and the distribution of tasks.

- How will you identify tasks, assign tasks, know when they are complete, and manage work in general?

By reading the summary together and building a network topology of what is required we can then check which tasks need to be done, then we can try to use our strengths identified above to assign those tasks accordingly following everyone’s opinion. We will know when things are complete when a member of the team completes a task and then the other members verify that it does what is needed for the project and that it is working flawlessly. 

- What project management tool will be used?

GitHub, link for our project will be: [VascoLucas01/NET2GRID-Acquisition-Project (github.com)](https://github.com/VascoLucas01/NET2GRID-Acquisition-Project)
